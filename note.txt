Json data imported from DynamoDB will always be invalid as it would appear in a form of:
{data: "name"}
{data: "name"}

You can solve this by validating your JSON data by following the steps:
in your VScode, cmd + P or ctrl + P as it will open the search bar,

1. Click on regex search method, paste this in your search bar: "\}$"
    - This regex will detect the last curly bracket of each of your json data line
    
2. Replace it with " }, "
    - This will replace every last curly bracket with a comma tracing, this is to
    properly format your json data.

3. Select all of your json data, place it inside a sqaure bracket "[]"

4. Your json is now a valid json, you can format this with prettier and your data is ready to be converted.
